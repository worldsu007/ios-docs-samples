# Dialogflow Sample

This app demonstrates how to make gRPC connections to the [Dialogflow API](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/)

The app demonstrates how to detect intents:
- Via Text
- Via Streaming Audio
- With Sentiment Analysis
- With Text-to-Speech
- With Knowledge Connectors

To call the Dialogflow API from iOS, you need to provide authorization tokens with each request for them to be accepted by the Dialogflow API. To get this token, this sample uses a Firebase Function (in Node.js) to generate these tokens on the behalf of a service account to be used by the app when making a request to the Dialogflow API.

## Prerequisites
- An OSX machine or simulator
- [Xcode 9.1][xcode] or later
- [Cocoapods][cocoapods] version 1.0 or later

## Setup
- Create a project with the [Google Cloud Console][cloud-console]
- Enable the [Dialogflow API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/librarydialogflow.googleapis.com).
- [Enable billing][billing].
- [Import the Dialogflow Agent](https://dialogflow.com/docs/agents/export-import-restore#import) using the `StopwatchAgent.zip` which is located in the `stopwatch` directory. 
- [Create a Service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) with the following IAM role: `Dialogflow API Client`. Example name: `dialogflow-client`. ([For more info on: how to add roles to a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource))
- For your "App Engine Default Service Account" add the following role `Service Account Token Creator` Role. ([For more info on: how to add roles to a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource))
- To use Sentiment Analysis you need to [Enable beta features](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/docs/sentiment#enable_beta_features) 
- To use Text-to-Speech you need to [Enable beta features](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/docs/detect-intent-tts#enable_beta_features)
- To use Knowledge Connectors you need to [Enable beta features](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow-enterprise/docs/knowledge-connectors#enable_beta_features) 


### Setup the app
- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ios-docs-samples.git` 
- `cd ios-docs-samples/dialogflow/stopwatch/` 
- Run `./INSTALL-COCOAPODS` to install app dependencies (this can take a long time to run). When it finishes, it will open the Stopwatch workspace in Xcode. Since we are using Cocoapods, be sure to open the `Stopwatch.xcworkspace` and not `Stopwatch.xcodeproj`.
- Replace `your-project-identifier` in `ApplicationConstants.swift` with the identifier of your Google Cloud project.

###  Setup Firebase on the application:

- Complete the steps for [Add Firebase to your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app). Note: No need to complete any other sections, they are already done. 
- Use `iOS bundle ID` as `com.sample.dialogflow`
- In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), open the "Authentication" section under Develop.
- On the **Sign-in Methods** page, enable the **Anonymous** sign-in method.

###  Setup and Deploy the Firebase Function 
The Firebase Function provides auth tokens to your app, You'll be using a provided sample function to be run with this app.

- Follow the steps in this [guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started) for: 
  - "1. Set up Node.js and the Firebase CLI"
  - "2. Initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions".
- Replace `index.js` file with the [provided index.js](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/blob/master/functions/dialogflow/functions/index.js).
- Open `index.js`, go to function "generateAccessToken", and replace “SERVICE-ACCOUNT-NAME@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com” with your Service account name (`dialogflow-client`) and project id. 
- Deploy getOAuthToken method by running command:
```
firebase deploy —only functions
```
- For more info please refer (https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started).


## Run the app
- You are now ready to build and run the project. In Xcode you can do this by clicking the 'Play' button in the top left. This will launch the app on the simulator or on the device you've selected. Be sure that the 'Stopwatch' target is selected in the popup near the top left of the Xcode window. 
- Tap the `Mic` button. This uses a custom AudioController class to capture audio in an in-memory instance of NSMutableData. When this data reaches a certain size, it is sent to the StopwatchService class, which streams it to the Dialogflow API. Packets are streamed as instances of the DFStreamingDetectIntentRequest object. The first DFStreamingDetectIntentRequest object sent includes configuration information and subsequent DFStreamingDetectIntentRequest objects contain audio packets. 
- Say a few words and wait for the display to update when your speech is recognized.
- Tap the 'close' button to stop capturing audio, or if audio capture has stopped because your speech was recognized, tap it again to start a new listening session.
